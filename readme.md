# Tennis Web Scoreboard Server

### About
When you are out on the tennis court, playing a friendly match, don't you wish there was an electronic means of keeping track of your match, game, set score via your mobile phone?  With the power of the web, you can keep track of your game *live and in real time* with all of your mates.

This project is the back-end server. It handles all the tennis scoring logic and broadcasts the tennis match to connected users associated with a valid session id.
